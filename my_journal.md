# My Journal

03/17/19 - 2nd Day of Class
Today had been another interesting expirience. My partner today is named Haydee (Heidi) and she is super nice.
We're running into issues with the limitations we're in. She is on a Windows 8 laptop, we can't Live Share in VSCode.
We can't screen share her computer; she missed a lot of day 1 and with my limited skills, we're bumbling through
some of it. She's really nice and i'm having a challenging in a good way time navigating. Right before lunch, we just 
got Github setup. So lunch break, and off to day two. I think skipping the README.md for now is what'll work best
and try CSS.
