# My Journal

03/17/19 - 2nd Day of Class
Today had been another interesting expirience. My partner today is named Haydee (Heidi) and she is super nice.
We're running into issues with the limitations we're in. She is on a Windows 8 laptop, we can't Live Share in VSCode.
We can't screen share her computer; she missed a lot of day 1 and with my limited skills, we're bumbling through
some of it. She's really nice and i'm having a challenging in a good way time navigating. Right before lunch, we just 
got Github setup. So lunch break, and off to day two. I think skipping the README.md for now is what'll work best
and try CSS.
Just finished the HTML pages- After standup, we'll start working on this.

Standup - Elena Wadsworth is our Student Advisor

At about 3:30 we started to split. After finding out what exactly needs to be explored by us, we felt the last hour should be spent catching up to todays plan. I need to memorize basic html setup; practice git and github updates/learn more about git and github, followup with html/css inspector view, and read tomorrows plan as well. Three things, 4 hours left in the day. Ready, BREAK!
