# My Journal

03/18/20
Its morning before class, I'm going over somethings that i need to ask about. One of them is the inspector, going over exactly what was trying to be explained. 2nd is the style sheets exercise. Then go over the specfics on branching and forking. You know, just most of what was covered yesterday. I'm hoping my pair today knows yesterdays material comfortably.
