Its morning before class, I'm going over somethings that i need to ask about. One of them is the inspector, going over exactly what was trying to be explained. 2nd is the style sheets exercise. Then go over the specfics on branching and forking. You know, just most of what was covered yesterday. I'm hoping my pair today knows yesterdays material comfortably.

Lunch time. I've got some fruit today. My partner today is named Tyler Bates. There are two Tyler B's. We're having a productive learning day. We're getting the hang of css and utilizing our prior knowledge. Both of us are helping each other, its another interesting day for sure. Going to go eat and stretch.

Were running live sharing issues and lag

And it's 6. Dinner is over; Danielle made cavatappin noodles with a pork red sauce. Salald included. Today went well. I put concepts together and feel like I'm able to catch up in the morning. I'm going to finish Tuesdays CSS and Wednesdays last 4 practices. Utilizing other rescources online to implment into the ideas i'm learning. I found a great site called https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-reference/css3-properties.php That will absolutley be on me screen most days. Read the README.md as well. A lot of reading.
